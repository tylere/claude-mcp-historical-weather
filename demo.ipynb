    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to extend Claude's capabilities with real-time data access. We'll build a system that allows Claude to access historical weather data and compare annual weather statistics between locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is MCP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard that enables AI models to securely connect with external data sources and tools. Instead of being limited to training data, models can access live information, APIs, and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Limitations of LLMs without external tools** - See how Claude responds to weather queries without access to real data\n",
    "2. **MCP Integration** - Connect Claude to a historical weather API\n",
    "3. **Data Visualization** - Create aesthetically pleasing charts comparing weather patterns\n",
    "4. **Interactive Analysis** - Ask Claude to analyze and compare weather data between locations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll have a working system that can:\n",
    "- Fetch historical weather data for locations\n",
    "- Compare annual weather statistics between cities\n",
    "- Generate visualizations and insights about weather patterns\n",
    "- Demonstrate the power of extending LLMs with external data sources"

    "- Implement additional weather statistics / climate indices. For inspiration, see the [ETCCDI Climate Change Indices](https://etccdi.pacificclimate.org/list_27_indices.shtml) compiled by [CLIVAR](https://www.clivar.org/).\n",
    "- Add functionality to analyze weather forecast data. The [Open-Meteo Weather Forecast API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs) (rather than the Historical Weather API used in this notebook) provides forecasts up to 16 days in the future.\n",
    "- Use this same approach to provide Claude access to other large datasets, such as genomic sequence data or satellite imagery!\n",
